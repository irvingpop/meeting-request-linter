# Overview
The purpose of this repository is to develop a [Linting tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) for meeting requests. Currently there's no such tool.  I have started with an auto-responder, which demonstrates some of the criteria.

# Calendar auto-responder
Thank you for inviting me to your meeting.  Did you know that since I became an Engineering Manager, I often attend over 25 hours worth of meetings per week?  This has taken a significant toll on me personally, but also impacts the amount of value I can deliver to our customers.

I hope you'll understand then why I am declining this meeting. To be more specific, I am declining it for one or more of the following reasons:
* No meeting agenda: Your invitation doesn't state the agenda and/or objectives of this meeting.
* The meeting length is not justified: If you scheduled this as an hour-long meeting, could it be a half-hour meeting instead?  If it's a half-hour meeting, could it be 15 minutes?
  * You could be even more respectful of attendees time by using "Speedy meetings" in google calendar
* The intended output of this meeting is a document. Please create the document first, give me a chance to review it and/or input any knowledge I have, and then we can have a much shorter meeting to discuss any open items.
* I already have 4 or more hours of meetings booked for this day.  Please be considerate of my time and other responsibilities by rescheduling to a different day.
* You have scheduled over the only break I might have between blocks of other meetings.
* You have not given me enough time to prepare for this meeting
* You have scheduled this meeting outside of my working hours, during time I would like to spend with my family.

I totally appreciate how hard scheduling can be around here,  sometimes it's a complete nightmare.  The only thing that keeps us sane is respecting each other's calendars :)
